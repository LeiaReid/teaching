## The teaching crisis

Teachers are leaving the public school system at the highest rate since records began. One in three teachers quit within the first five years. Schools have worked hard to shield pupils from the £2.8 billion gutted from the English and Welsh 

Schools have been doing all they can to shield their pupils from the damage caused by £2.8 billion being cut from school budgets since 2015, but the lack of investment is really biting. These cuts are now undeniably affecting front-line teaching.

But it’s not just funding cuts, staff are moving to warmer and higher paid climates, to different professions, and retiring at a larger rate. All while the department for education struggles to recruit teachers and maintain staffing targets.

DfE figures show that 36,000 working-age teachers stepped down from the profession last year, with fewer being trained. But pupil figures are set to rise by 19% over the next decade; and we’ve still to get the Y2K (year 2000) baby-boom  high school! Needless to say, this stressful enviroment doesn't allow teachers to flourish, which endangers childrens' ability to learn.

**Staff Numbers VS pupil numbers**

According to Department for Education figures, staff numbers in secondary schools have fallen by 15,000 between 2014/15 and 2016/17 despite having 4,500 more pupils to teach.

These frontline cuts are happening when classroom sizes are at their largest, which means less attention for children, and more stress for teachers.
 
Despite the Government’s claims to be concerned about underfunded areas, some of the largest staffing cuts are in the areas with the lowest average funding per pupil such as: Reading, Isle of Wight, Central Bedfordshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, York, Derby and Milton Keynes.
 
The National Education Union, who conducted research into these figures, reported the introduction of the National Funding Formula wouldn’t solve this. Four of the five worst hit local authorities – Middlesbrough, Reading, Isle of Wight, Doncaster – face further budget cuts over the next two years. This will keep putting pressure on staff staff numbers.


**Funding cuts in staff numbers**

When per-pupil funding levels started to fall, secondary schools lost 5.5 staff members on average. That’s 2.4 fewer classroom teachers, 1.6 fewer teaching assistants and 1.5 fewer support staff, according to the National Education Union.

Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned that school support staff are “feeling the brunt” of school cuts, with redundancies forcing the what staff is left to do more.
 
Research by the NEU found that 78 per cent of teaching assistants, school administrators and other support staff are working overtime every week, with 20 per cent claiming their school expects them to work extra hours and 5 per cent saying their school demands it of them. More than 60 per cent of respondents are not paid for their overtime.
 
Of the support staff who told the NEU that they worked overtime, 73 per cent blamed workload, 32 per cent said they worked at least an extra two days every month on top of their contracted hours, while 13 per cent said they worked at least an extra seven hours every week, equal to a whole extra day. 33 per cent rarely or never take their full lunch break, despite not being paid for it.
 
“Support staff are feeling the brunt of school cuts as schools struggle to make ends meet,” warned Bousted, “Many are being made redundant, and those remaining are being expected to do more for the same pay. Not only is this blatantly unfair, it is also putting support staff under considerable pressure and making many ill. If the government fails to find any more money for schools, children will start suffering as more staff go off sick with stress.”
 
Pupil numbers at secondary level are expected to rise by 19 per cent by 2025 as a result of the early 2000s baby boom.

**Staff moving to warmer - and higher paid - climates.**

In 2016 Ofsted warned thousands of teachers are being lured abroad with lucrative pay packages as England's struggled to recruit.
More teachers left the UK, 18,000, to teach than trained, 17,000, on English postgraduate routes, according to department for education 2015 figures.

According to the Council of British Schools, teachers were motivated to work abroad for: travel and cultural exploration 71%,  enjoyment and a challenge 63%, dissatisfaction with home education system 47%, career growth 45%, and finally salary 44%.

Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw called for urgent action to plug the flood of teachers leaving the UK to teach abroad – fuelled by a “worldwide boom in international schools”.

Sir Michael highlighted the figures, in his monthly blog, questioning if it’s, “fair the offspring of overseas oligarchs are directly benefiting from UK teacher training programmes at the expense of poor children in large parts of this country?”
 
Notably, Sir Michael said the lure of tax-free salaries and sunnier climates has contributed to a teacher “brain drain” in the UK which will, “undermine the well-intentioned reforms to school structures, curricula and assessment regimes.”
 
International Schools Consultancy figures project there will be more than double in 15,000 by 2025.
 
**Staffing levels**
 
£1.3m was spent plugging the hole with substitute teachers in 2015-16, according to a parliamentary answer from the DfE.

A Department for Education spokesman said: "Despite the challenge of a competitive jobs market, the proportion of trainee teachers with a top degree has grown faster than in the population as a whole, and there are more teachers overall.

"But we are determined to continue raising the status of the profession.

"That's why we're investing hundreds of millions in teacher recruitment, backing schemes like Teach First and the National Teaching Service to get great teachers where they are most needed, and why we've given schools unprecedented freedom over staff pay, to allow them to attract the brightest and the best.

"The number of former teachers returning to the classroom has increased year on year - further evidence of the popularity of the profession.”

 
**Education in Wales**
 

This open letter graced the hands of parents this month, as schools pressured parents to pressure policy makers to make up the education shortfall. 

Sam Daniels, head teacher of Victoria Primary in Penarth emailed this open letter - titled The Funding Crisis Deepens - on behalf of heads from a cluster of 16 schools in the Vale of Glamorgan; the worst affected Welsh area, who have suffered £1m in per pupil funding.
But the Welsh government said school funding was the responsibility of local authorities - confirming to myself in an email the Vale of Glamorgan did spend the least per pupil in Wales, and would run a £1m deficit. 

A spokesman said to myself in an email and in a press release online: "Every local authority must have a school budget forum – as set out in law – where schools have the opportunity to influence the funding decisions their authorities make. Local Authorities must also consult their schools budget forums and all schools in their area when setting a funding formula.

"We recently announced the single biggest investment for teachers since devolution – a £24m package of professional learning to support the new curriculum, giving schools the time and resources they need.

“It is important to note that Welsh Government has presented local authorities, including Vale of Glamorgan, with proposals to update the 1991 census related element of the current funding formula for local government, however this proposal was not pursued."

The Welsh Branch of the NUT warn this package isn’t enough, in an email to myself and published online: “Westminster cuts to the Welsh Government’s budget over recent years have severely impacted on public services.

“With the way Wales is funded, future plans to cut public spending by the Westminster Government will only reduce the money available for Welsh schools. 

“The General Election is a chance to ensure proper funding for education and all public services in Wales. NUT Cymru will be calling on all candidates to ensure Wales gets the money it needs to tackle concern over school cuts.” 

Department for education data shows a £640 difference on average per English and Welsh pupil.
